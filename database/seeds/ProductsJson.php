IRL yelling and excitement may occur in this ultimate two-player showdown of fast-paced fencing and melee attacks. Beware advantages in Nidhogg are often fleeting as new opponents continually spawn in your way.  Use a variety of fencing maneuvers while armed -- lunges parries and even dirty tricks like throwing your sword.  If swordless press forward with punches sweep kicks dive kicks rolls and wall jumps. The combat arena stretches in both directions although besting an opponent only gains you ground. Matches arent won or lost with a single kill but with a series of kills granting you right-of-way to run/fight/flee to your own goal-zone. Each arena holds different strategic formations and chokepoints to use to your advantage.  Until you reach your goal-zone anything is possible. Only one thing is certain in Nidhogg... the only way to win is to outwit your opponent. En Garde!",

Game speed is adjustable and commands can even be issued while the game is paused.It also features an engaging character-driven story written by an actual English major! The story strives to be fast-paced snappy and always relevant to gameplay with minimal exposition.

Playable on PC Mac OSX and Linux with multiplayer cross-compatibility. Dedicated Server Support for PC and Linux.Multiplayer Game Modes:Push --- Three territorial objectives must be captured by the attacking team in sequential order. For each objective captured they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers a fourth cache objective must be destroyed while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand.Firefight --- Three territorial objectives one for each team plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork.Skirmish --- In addition to three territorial objectives each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves it becomes a Firefight match.Occupy --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or tug of war.Ambush --- A high value target (HVT) must be escorted to an extraction point. Its one teams goal to make this happen and its the other teams goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate.Strike --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry.Infiltrate --- The standard Capture the Flag mode but with a twist. Your teams goal is to take the enemys intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemys intel or when an enemy stealing your teams intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy.Flashpoint --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area controlling the middle and destroying the enemys caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective.Elimination --- In this single life mode attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers.Cooperative Game ModesCheckpoint --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way.Hunt --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension with only one-life.Survival --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates.Outpost --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates.Conquer --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.",

          "price": 24.99,
          "description": "Xenonauts is a strategy game in which you control a multi-national military organisation defending a Cold War-era Earth from alien invasion using small squads of persistent soldiers to eliminate the extraterrestrials and recover their technology in turn-based ground combat. A detailed strategic layer allows you to co-ordinate the defence of the planet using your interceptors to shoot down UFOs and researching captured artefacts to learn about your foes and unlock new combat equipment to use on your missions.Xenonauts is a spiritual successor to the classic X-Com strategy games from the 1990s. We aim to improve the graphics add new content and streamline the interface whilst still retaining all of the key mechanics of the original games. Devoted fans should love this game but were also keen to introduce the joys of old-school grand strategy to a whole new generation of players who might not otherwise experience it!Please note that the native Mac / Linux versions of the game are still in beta however older WINE-wrapped ports are available and known to be stable whilst development of the native ports is still ongoing.Key Features Ground Combat: Xenonauts delivers tense turn-based combat across realistic varied and fully-destructible battlefields against almost fifty different variants of enemy. Missions range from capturing crashed UFOs or alien bases to defending cities (or even Xenonaut facilities) against alien attack. Youll experience the chill of encountering a new alien for the first time and the joys of test-firing a new weapon for the first time. Deeply asymmetric combat keeps the battles interesting - after all youre fighting intergalactic invaders with 1970s ballistic technology! Strategic Management: You will also be managing the defence of the planet dealing with the invading alien UFOs with your customisable interceptors. You need to balance the needs of your funding nations with your own. Your funds are limited - are you going to spend them on battlefield equipment more scientists or expanding your coverage of the planet? Your priorities must be balanced carefully if you are to win the war. Research Tree: Xenonauts has an extensive research tree with almost a hundred projects to unlock each with its own unique description and painted artwork. It slowly reveals the intentions and origins of the invaders while also unlocking new battlefield equipment aircraft and vehicles for you to use as you harness alien technology and turn it against them.  Persistent Soldiers: Soldiers in Xenonauts are persistent from mission to mission improving their stats and gaining ranks with combat experience - but their deaths are always only a single bad move away. You will grow to care about the brave men and women under your command as they slowly grow from green rookies into hardened veterans but that only makes it more painful when their heroic tale is cruelly cut short by a burst of plasma fire... Detailed Emergent Simulation: Xenonauts contains no scripted missions just broad rules setting the pace of the invasion. As such no game plays out the same twice. If you shoot a Scout UFO down over a polar area you get a Crash Site mission where you can capture a crashed Scout UFO in an Arctic tileset. Commence a battle at night and youll be fighting the mission in the darkness with reduced sight range. If your base is attacked you fight the defence in a perfect replica of your base. A lot of time has gone into weaving the two very different halves of the game together into something that feels both natural and enjoyable.",

Some of the colonists survive in lifeboats but what they find is an unforgiving land filled with creatures ready to outlast the visitors from Earth. Now the survivors must explorer gather build create fight and ultimately build a new home.Game ModesPlanet Explorers will feature single and multiplayer modes. In single player there are 3 distinct selections Story Mode - Story mode is the main meat and bones of the game it is the action-adventure-rpg-somewhat-4X segment offering npcs missions colony building farming ranching training diplomacy and of course a storyline that you can follow or ignore. This story features a 17X8km world map with many unique character landscapes biomes locations and over 100 types of potential enemies. Even though weve made it seem like a very action oriented game in the trailers in reality players can choose to not fight so much as to just plant a farm make some food keep the colonists alive negotiate with the sentient aliens and defend the perimeter from the local life forms. That can still eventually arrive at the ending. And yes there is an ending. Story mode also features coop with other players.Adventure Mode - This mode is based on a procedural map generated from a seed. Currently it comes in a 40X40 kilometer map. Players will be able to complete random missions defeat bosses and explore different landscapes in the mode and eventually be able to setup conditions that they want to play (such as tower defense or attack an alien camp). This mode will also feature survival gameplay. The randomization in this mode will eventually pull in player made objects and locations so that a world will always feature something new and unique.Build Mode - In this mode there are no enemies and an infinite amount of building material. It also currently comes in a 40X40km map. Players will be able to build whatever they want in this mode including everything in the Creations Editor. Think of this as the perfect testing ground to test everything you build. Or...its your place to build your garden without ever worrying about the pesky aliens.Multiplayer allows Local Area Network and player hosted servers. It features several modes but some are still on the drawing board or going through technical trials so the final result is still in flux. Players playing multiplayer should be able to bring at least one of their created objects into multiplayer games be it a sword gun or vehicle. Coop - Coop comes in many selections such as adventure mode tower defense mode build mode etc. This is pretty much an open world sandbox with a max of 32 players (this number still needs to be stress tested).Versus - This mode allows teams of up to 16 players to battle against 16 players from another team.

          "description": "Verdun is the first multiplayer FPS set in a realistic World War One setting. The merciless trench warfare offers a unique battlefield experience immersing you and your squad into intense battles of attack and defense.The game takes place on the western front between 1914 and 1918 in one of the bloodiest conflicts in world history. The developers were inspired by the infamous Battle of Verdun in 1916. The game offers 4 distinct game-modes: Frontlines Attrition Rifle Deathmatch and Squad Defense. There are also many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry authentic uniforms horrendous gore and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium.The Frontlines game mode is unique in its tactical complexity. The realistic trenches are challenging to fight in and require tactical cunning to capture and defend. The Entente and Central Powers strive to gain control of frontline sectors. In one battle youll find yourself rushing the enemy trenches during an offensive action in order to gain ground while in another you might be defending your recently conquered ground against a fierce enemy counter-attack.Players can choose to be part of one of the many squad types in the game each of which have their own distinct tactical roles. By working together with your friends you can earn experience that improves the power and versatility of your squad. As you gain more experience fighting and get promoted in rank you also earn Career Points which you can use to unlock specializations weapons and equipment.In the Attrition game mode the Entente and the Central Powers are pitted against each other in a single battle. Each side has a number of tickets which represents the amount of manpower they have. When a player is killed and respawns a ticket is deducted from the side they belonged to. When a side has no more tickets players of that side cannot respawn - the last side standing wins! The Rifle Deathmatch is a free-for-all game mode where all players are pitted against each other in a thrilling contest of skill using only bolt-action rifles. In the Squad Defense mode the player along with three squad-mates will have to defend a position as long as they can against endless waves of AI controlled attackers.Verdun key features include: *Realistic World War 1 gameplay: Authentic weaponry with realistic bullet physics skill based weapon handling gore poisonous gas with a claustrophobic gas mask experience horrendous gore and artillery barrages*Tactical squad-based FPS:  Unique squad leveling system distinct squad types and roles voice chat*True trench warfare:   Real-time dynamic frontline with momentum-based attack and counter-attack gameplay*Authentic World War 1 setting:  Typical WW1 music and style historical battlefields set on the Western Front*Challenging game modes:  Team-based Frontline tactical Attrition skill-based Rifle Deathmatch and desperate survival in Squad DefenseThe gameplay is as immersive and gritty as it can get with elements such as realistic gore that portrays the true horror of the 1st World War Battlefield. This feature can naturally be disable if preferred. The authentic weapons need to be handled with skill as they each feel differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim.  Also the realistic bullet physics require you to lead your shots when firing on a moving target at long range. In the event of a gas attack you need to put on your gas mask which impairs your view and gives you a very claustrophobic experience. And if getting shot or gassed isnt enough sudden artillery barrages that are called in by NCOs can pin you down if youre caught in the open and might obliterate your entire squad. This unforgiving war isnt for the faint hearted! Team play is what lies at the heart of Verdun. When you start a game your first choice is to fight for either the Entente or the Central Powers. You can form one of the different squad types available to that side with up to three of your friends.  Each squad has a specific tactic that is based on the historical units of that time. Depending on your squads type players can choose a specific role within the squad complete with historically accurate attire weapons and special abilities. The more Co-op experience you and your squad mates earn together the more powerful your squad will become and the better abilities will  be unlocked. This progression is also shown visually as you and your squad get more advanced uniforms. You will also earn Career Points which can be spent to unlock specializations weapons and equipment. The true WW1 battlefield experience has been captured in a real-time dynamic frontline set in historically accurate locations of the Western Front. These frontline maps are comprised out of multiple sectors that can be captured by either side. Staying true to the typical attrition warfare of that time both sides attack and counter-attack each other in turn compelling you to defend each captured sector of trenches! The development team has done extensive field research at Verdun and has been advised by knowledgeable historians to make sure Verdun is as historically accurate as it can get. Uniforms have been recreated to the tiniest details the weapons are modeled to exact references and the maps use realistic World War 1 props and terrain layouts. Also everything in the game has been tailored to recreate the grim atmosphere that is so typical of WW1; Gloomy clouded skies an immersive interface combined with realistic sounds accurate native voices that evoke the feeling of actually being there in the trenches mud covered - trenches whilst peering over your rifle to spot the enemy.",

The Japanese government is grappling with intensified external (Asia geopolitics) and internal (economic/social) problems and there is mounting pressure from within Japan to return to the days when it exerted influence through military power and strength. A failed legislative push to alter the Japanese Constitution (allowing the Japanese military to engage in offensive actions outside of the country) leads to an attempted military coup by members of Japans armed forces (GSDF). The coup fails but was very close to succeeding. In an effort to suppress further coup attempts Japans Prime Minister forms a branch inside the Interior Ministrys National Security Forces (NSF) called GROUP SIX. They answer directly to the Prime Minister and are sworn to protect the Japanese Constitution at all costs. They immediately begin to hear rumors of a rogue element of the GSDF Special Forces (JINRAI) maneuvering for a second coup attempt. These JINRAI are Special Operations Group 43 (SOG43) fierce nationalist loyal to their love of country and a desire to put Japan back into a position of strength and power.This begins the war in the shadows between the NSF and JINRAI.",

Divekicks focused gameplay demonstrates how much depth a single move actually has and introduces (or reinforces) skills fundamental to the genre: mind games spacing timing and quick reactions.At Iron Galaxy we love fighting games. To the average fan most of what makes them fun is hidden behind a never-ending series of input combinations that they have to memorize. Thats why Divekick has just two buttons: Dive (into the air) makes your character jump straight up. Kick causes your character to fly foot first at a downward angle. If you press Kick on the ground you can jump away from your opponent. Utilizing these moves the first hit will win the round and the player that wins five rounds first wins the game. Its pure adrenaline awareness and outsmarting your enemy. Its a fighting game deconstructed into its purest form.

Players build space ships space stations planetary outposts of various sizes and uses (civil and military) pilot ships and travel through space to explore planets and gather resources to survive. Featuring both creative and survival modes there is no limit to what can be built utilized and explored.Space Engineers features a realistic volumetric-based physics engine: everything in the game can be assembled disassembled damaged and destroyed. The game can be played either in single or multiplayer modes.Volumetric objects are structures composed from block-like modules interlocked in a grid. Volumetric objects behave like real physical objects with mass inertia and velocity. Individual modules have real volume and storage capacity.Space Engineers is inspired by reality and by how things work. Think about modern-day NASA technology extrapolated 60 years into the future. Space Engineers strives to follow the laws of physics and doesnt use technologies that wouldnt be feasible in the near future.Space Engineers concentrates on construction and exploration aspects but can be played as a survival shooter as well. We expect players will avoid engaging in direct man-to-man combat and instead use their creativity and engineering skills to build war machines and fortifications to survive in space and on planets.

          "description": "NETHER...IS...BACK!  We have rolled back the game to Summer of 2014 when it first left Early Access and was still being developed by us Phosphor Games Studio.  RIGHT NOW:- Single Player enabled: It was not possible before but now its working and its hard!  Have fun surviving the monster-filled urban apocalypse alone- No more micro-transactions: all items can be bought with in game cash- Multiplayer via player hosted servers! The old back end ripped out - no need for any login besides Steam.  You control your community and nobody can take your game from you againWHAT IS IN DEVELOPMENT:- Custom server settings: you decided how many players how many Nether how much gun spawns etc.- Modding tools![/b]- Bug fixes (including playing as a Nether which was always pretty buggyGAME SUMMARY:Nether is a fast-paced survival game that forces you to make quick life-saving decisions in an unforgiving environment. In this post-apocalyptic urban world death is waiting around every corner at the top of high-rise buildings and in the grasp of powerful teleporting creatures known as Nethers. These creatures and the other players are real challenges to overcome requiring tactical gameplay awareness stealth and cooperation. To navigate this high-tension environment you must use skill and cunning in order to scavenge trade craft or loot for food weapons supplies and other resources necessary to stay alive in a desolate and dangerous city. Team up with other survivors and take advantage of group play as a tribe to complete treacherous world objectives or play as a lone wolf in an attempt to endure the hostile environment. In the end you must decide whether to Prey or Pray.Key FeaturesEXPLOREThe games landscape is a beautifully conceived vision of a post apocalyptic Chicago ravaged by disaster and time. Almost every low and high-rise building can be individually explored in a cityscape that stretches 150 blocks. Beyond the city lies the Wastelands an unforgiving desolate landscape that is slowly sinking into the earth. SURVIVE CRAFT TRADE LOOT AND SHOOTStart off armed only with a kitchen knife and scavenge your way through an environment on a daily battle to stay alive. Beware the Nether poor mutated souls who roam the city in search of human flesh. Scavenge for food and water to stay nourished and search for useful items that could be crafted into makeshift weapons to help in your battle for life.  Hunt and kill Nether to trade their body parts to the mysterious Cult located in the few markets that scatter the city. Over time build up your skills and earn rewards for surviving each precious new day. But always beware of the other survivors who may be only one moment away from death and see killing you and looting your possessions as their only salvation. TRIBES AND TERRITORY WARS Find safety in numbers by joining a tribe. Only tribes can capture and own territory and the urban landscape is the perfect setting for turf domination. Compete with rival tribes in territory wars for control of the city by capturing strategic landmarks to reap resources and experience; prove your dominance over all other tribes. Spy on rival tribes or infiltrate and kill them by playing as a Nether. Ambush them from above by swooping in for the kill using the wing suit. Tribes change the survival experience by establishing a true social construct with all the consequences of behavior that you would expect in the real world. Your actions have real repercussions enforced organically through reputation and standing.PLAYER AND GROUP MISSIONSPlayers can complete an assortment of individual or group missions to earn money experience and reputation. Perform vital supply runs between the markets work with your tribe to take down the swarms of Nether lead by the vicious boss Reaper that sporadically surge to attack neighborhoods or keep the creatures out of the Safezones by working in groups to repair the anti-nether devices when they fail.CHARACTER CUSTOMIZATION Nether offers a wide variety of character customization and allows you to play as a male or female character. There is a huge selection of cosmetic items and player taunts to assert your individuality along with entire outfits to play roles like survivalist soldier and biker - or even just play in your underwear.OTHERHost your own private servers and control your settings and player populationFirst-person perspective creates a true survival experienceMeld of PvE (player versus environment) and PvP (player versus player) gameplayNew weapons and items become available as players explore the game worldUp to 64 players per game serverSingle purchase downloadable client allows full game access without subscription",

Its the antidote to racing games!!In 1997 a videogame was released that caused establishment scandal and media hysteria around the world. Banned in some countries censored in others and even condemned by a Pope overnight it became the poster child for everything thats wrong in society... and therefore right in a videogame. The game was CARMAGEDDON. For a generation of gamers coming to the end of a decade of 2D wireframe and corridor combat it was an awesome introduction to the concept of the real 3D open world do-whatever-the-feck-you-like chuck-out-the-rulebook-and-just-BE-STUPID gameplay. And in doing so it also introduced the gaming world to the whole concept of realistic physics and real-time dynamic damage. Whats more it was the FUNNIEST GAME EVER.So what have we done to update the game that was not only one of the most controversial titles of its day but also the most innovative and technically advanced of its generation? Well controversy is pretty hard to whip up these days but we are still proudly offering you the chance to turn PEDESTRIANS into POINTS (which continues to get certain sections of society hot under the collar) using your car or a whole host of hilarious ped pulping POWERUPS!

Carmageddon: Reincarnation features a wide and varied range of cool crazy custom killing machines; each with its own highly distinctive character. Carmageddon cars are specifically built for the job in hand - wrecking opponents and killing peds! Carmageddon basically invented the whole concept of videogame physics and real-time damaging of cars and the scenery and so its obviously our responsibility to bring this technology BANG up-to-date with a brand new state of the art car damage (and repair) system. Crush bend twist and completely mangle your opponents and your own car - smash parts off or split it in two; the original game was all about wrecking motors and pummelling pedestrians and well be taking this to a whole new level! Of course Power Armour and Offensive upgrades make a return along with new customising options allowing you to personalise the killing capabilities of your preferred rides.A host of old favourites make a comeback along with some all-new faces. Only ever seen before as low resolution mugshots now you get to see them from head to toe (well head to knees in the case of Screwie) in full HD 3D glory - usually as they smash through their windscreen and hurtle past (or INTO) yours!The new environments are amalgamations of the best bits from the numerous chunks of landscape that we all loved to tear around in Carmageddon. Bleak City Dusty Trails MagNuChem and Snowy levels all return in updated forms with their memorable landmark features such as the Loop de Loop acid pits and Football Stadium. Everything is reassuringly surreal; hell weve even managed to incorporate a giant food mixer into a level!The topography and detail in the locations is updated and enhanced with even more fun stuff to smash into smash up snap off and send careening into the poor pedestrian population. Nice Shot Sir! And talking of pedestrians...Once again the game features a varied mix of adult pedestrians of all ages shapes persuasions and species (Carmageddon is an equal opportunities Ped Slaughterfest). Classic pedestrians are back such as old lady on a Zimmer frame and old man with his stick with their famous cry I was in the war! plus bikini babes and swimming trunk hunks fat bastards and herds of cows in improbable locations. Joining them are some new faces - including the Stainless dev team and some guest appearances by the generous Kickstarter Backers who pledged their way into a VIP role in the game!PowerUps are back (well they couldnt not appear in a game bearing the name Carmageddon could they!) and this time theyre even funnier surrealier hurtier and messier than ever! Lots of the classic PUps (as we call them) return in super-enhanced form such as Repulsificators Kangaroos & Solid Granites. Then we have all new PUps like Pelvic Thrust and a variety under the heading Tossers! Combine PUps to create hilarious combo results like Groovin Helium Filled Peds or Peds without legs at the Temporary Rapture!Leaderboards.
