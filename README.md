### About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications.

    - Change the database settings: `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`
    - generate a application key by running: `php artisan key:generate`
8. Setup database by runnning `php artisan migrate:refresh --seed`:
9. Run the project: `php artisan serve`

All seeded passwords of the users are: **secret**  

To get the email you will have to look at the database table users. All data is being generated by faker except the product. Those are taken from a third party public api
